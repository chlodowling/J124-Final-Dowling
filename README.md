3. ### Ask Questions
    1. Which ethnic group in Hawaii received the most transplants in 2022? Is this proportional to the state’s 2022 population demographics? And is this proportional to the ethnic group that receives the most transplants in the United States?
    2. From 1988 to present, has the ethnic group that receives the most transplants each year in Hawaii changed over time? If so, in what year(s) was it different than the group found in question #1?
    3.  Which disease has led to the most transplants in Hawaii, from 1988-present?
    4. What is the breakdown of the most common diagnosis by ethnic group in Hawaii, from 1988-present, that results in requiring an organ transplant? 
    5. What is the one disease that has impacted individuals from all 8 ethnic groups in Hawaii, listed by UNOS, and has resulted in an organ transplant? Is this in line with the United State’s most common diagnosis that results in requiring an organ transplant?

## Data Analysis 
I analayzed my data in order of questions. 

1. ### Which ethnic group in Hawaii received the most transplants in 2022? Is this proportional to the state’s 2022 population demographics? And is this proportional to the ethnic group that receives the most transplants in the United States?
    1. First, I looked at the "HI Transplants/Ethnicity" sheet. 
    2. Then, I created a pivot table that summed up the total number of organ transplants for each ethnic group in 2022.
    3. To create the pivot table I input the ethnicities from Column A as the rows and sorted by SUM of 2022 in descending order. Next I input the values to be 2022, sumarized by SUM. To ensure I was only looking a necessary data, I filtered out both blank cells and "All ethnicities" as I only needed the individual breakdowns of each ethnicity.
