3. ### Ask Questions
    1. Which ethnic group in Hawaii received the most transplants in 2021? Is this proportional to Hawaii’s 2021 population demographics? 
    2. From 1988 to present, has the ethnic group that receives the most transplants each year in Hawaii changed over time? If so, in what year(s) was it different than the group found in question #1?
    3.  Which disease has led to the most transplants in Hawaii, from 1988-present?
    4. What is the breakdown of the most common diagnosis by ethnic group in Hawaii, from 1988-present, that results in requiring an organ transplant? 
    5. What is the one disease that has impacted individuals from all 8 ethnic groups in Hawaii, listed by UNOS, and has resulted in an organ transplant? Is this in line with the United State’s most common diagnosis that results in requiring an organ transplant?

## Data Analysis 
I analayzed my data in order of questions. 

1. ### Which ethnic group in Hawaii received the most transplants in 2021? Is this proportional to Hawaii’s 2021 population demographics? 
* First, I looked at the "HI Transplants/Ethnicity" sheet. 
* Then, I created a pivot table that summed up the total number of organ transplants for each ethnic group in 2021.
* To create the pivot table I input the ethnicities from Column A as the rows and sorted by SUM of 2021 in descending order. Next I input the values to be 2021, sumarized by SUM. To ensure I was only looking at necessary data, I filtered out both blank cells and "All ethnicities" as I only needed the individual breakdowns of each ethnicity.

* From this pivot table, it is clear that of the 64 total organ transplants that occured in Hawaii in 2021, 35 of the transplant recipients  Asian, Non-Hispanic patients. 
* Then, to compare this to Hawaii's population demographics from 2021, I referred to the United States Sensus Bureau's 1-Year Estimate Detailed Table, derived from the 2021 American Community Survey. This table breaks down Hawaii's population demogrpahics for 2021. This data was imported into my google sheets workspace and is accessible under the "Hawaii US Census Datat 2021" sheet and is also seen below.

* To analyze this data, I looked at row 6, "Asian alone," which states in 2021, of the 1,441,553 people in Hawaii 536,161 were Asian.
* To see if the amount of organ transplants on Asian patients is proportional to Hawaii's percetage of Asians in the state, I compared the percentage of Asian transplant recipients in Hawaii to Hawaii's percentage of Asian residents. To do this, I first found the percentage of organ transpalants on Asian patients in 2021, which is:
    * (35/64)(100) = 54.68% 
 
* Then I found the percentage of Asian residents in Hawaii in 2021, which is:
    * (536,161/1,441,553)(100) = 37.19%
 
* This means that in 2021, the percentage of Asian patients who received organ transplants in Hawaii in 2021 was _**not proportional**_ to the number of Asian residents in Hawaii in 2021 as the percentage of Asian organ donations is much larger than the percentage of Asian residents in Hawaii.
